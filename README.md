# Modern websites for the ZX Spectrum

This is my take on how some modern websites would be designed for the ZX Spectrum. This is just an emulator, there is no connection to the internet and not all options shown in the screen will work (though I tried to do most of them)

Currently it has redesigns for:
* Google (Search, Images and Account)
* Hacker news

## Files

Currently the repository has 2 type of files:
* *.bas These are the source code written in Sinclair BASIC
* *.tap These are files in "tape" format which can be loaded with ZX spectrum emulators such as Fuse.
